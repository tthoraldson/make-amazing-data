# How to Make Amazing Data!
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koiTTim4M-s
To view my walk-through of this tutorial, you will need to run the following commands on your machine using conda:
```
conda create -n make-data-amazing python=2
conda install jupyter pandas
conda source activate make-data-amazing
```

Then you will run Jupyter:
(Make sure you are in the cloned repo directory when running Jupyter)
```
jupyter notebook
```
Copy and paste the prompted URL. It usually starts with 'http://localhost:8888/?token='. You should now be loaded into Jupyter Notebook. Click on 'tutorial.ipynb' to view my work.
